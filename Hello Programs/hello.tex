\title{Ice-cream}
Vanilla is what angels are made of, synthesied by the almighty himself, so light, so pure that it lifts both you and your drowned spirits better than a pound of cocaine and whiskey together on a Sunday morning in bed with the person you love.\

What I mean to say is.... I love it.
